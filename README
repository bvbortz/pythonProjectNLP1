the ex2_nlp.py file contains:
Baseline_tagger class which is the most likely tag baseline
bigram_tag_and_prev_tag class which is the transition probability
bigram_word_given_tag class which is the emission probability
bigram_HMM class which is the bigram HMM tagger
functions:
bigram_prob used to get the probability in bigram_tag_and_prev_tag and bigram_word_given_tag
train- used to train the model
accuracy used to report the accuracy on the test
